how old are you : 19

not on campus
used food delivery once or twice
just food to eat quickly if ordering
doesnt really think any problems - generally easier
on average willing to spend 10 or lower quid 
not catered
easier the better, no go-to food really
nothing to change that can think of
reviews are a bit important
